# Agot

The final version of my ELO and deck tracking project for games on thejoustingpavilion.com, an extremely awesome
website that makes running tournaments for the A Game of Thrones LCG 2nd edition much easier and allows plebs
to follow along with the competitive scene. A link to the site will be posted once I launch, but if you want
to see what this project is all about before then, feel free to clone this repo and get it running using the
steps listed below. Also worth noting, the initial database seeding will take up to an hour and will require
an active internet connection

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
